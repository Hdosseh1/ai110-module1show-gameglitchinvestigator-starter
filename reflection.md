# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the secret number kept changing" or "the hints were backwards").
When I first run the game, I noticed that the hint was wrong. It said the secret number was lower than my first guess which was 2 - suggesting that 1 was the secret number since I could only pick between 1 and 100. However, this was still marked as incorrect. I was also given just 4 tries although I had 8 tries in total. Lastly, I was able to enter 0 as a guess and did not have an error message although it was beyond the limit of numbers I could enter.

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
- Give one example of an AI suggestion you accepted and why.
- Give one example of an AI suggestion you changed or rejected and why.
For this project I solely used Copilot as my AI tool. I accepted all the suggestions from Copilot because after checking each and every suggestion it made, I found them correct.

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?
After running pytest and rerunning the game live, I checked the errors that were supposed to be fix and once they weren't present, I concluded that bug was fixed. In my IDE, I used pytest to run the test file and for each bug, the test passed after the bugs had been fixed. The test files used to check the errors after fixing were all generated by Copilot and were fairly easy to understand.

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- In your own words, explain why the secret number kept changing in the original app.
- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
- What change did you make that finally gave the game a stable secret number?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
